God, you are always pleased to show yourself to those who are childlike and humble in spirit: help us to follow the example of our blessed father Francis, to look upon the wisdom of this world as foolishness, and to set our minds only on Christ Jesus and him crucified; to whom with you and the Holy Spirit be all glory for ever. <strong>Amen</strong>
