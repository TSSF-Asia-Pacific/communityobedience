We aim to stay free from all attachment to wealth, keeping ourselves constantly aware of the poverty in the world and its claim on us. We are concerned more for the generosity that gives all, rather than the value of poverty in itself. In this way we reflect in spirit the acceptance of Jesus' challenge to sell all, give to the poor, and follow him.</source>
        <target>個人洗費僅限於我們及家屬的健康和福祉所需。我們的目標是從所有對財富的依附中釋放自己，並時刻意識到世上的貧窮及其當中對我們的索求。我們更着重捐獻一切的慷慨，而不是關心貧窮本身的價值。透過這種方式，我們在靈性上反映出，我們願意接受耶穌的挑戰，變賣所有的，分給窮人，並跟隨他。</target>
