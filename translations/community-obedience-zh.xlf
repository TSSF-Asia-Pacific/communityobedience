  {% trans into lang %}All powerful and everliving God,
we praise you that you turned our weakness into strength:
as you called Maximilian Kolbe
to give his life for a brother,
grant us the grace to live in faithful witness to you,
even unto death;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.{% endtrans %} <strong>{% trans into lang %}Amen{% endtrans %}</strong>
