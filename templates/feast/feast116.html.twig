Collect for First Franciscan Martyrs

Everliving God,
we thank you for the brothers by whose martyrdom
the beginnings of the Franciscan Order were sanctified:
grant that following their example and
strengthened by their fellowship
we may give our lives to your service, even unto death,
and share with them your gifts of eternal life;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
