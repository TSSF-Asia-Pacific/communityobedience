Collect for All Franciscan Saints

Everlasting God,
you have adorned your Church
with splendours of the saintly followers of our holy father, Francis:
grant that as we commemorate their holiness
we may come at last with all the pure in heart
to share the vision of your glory;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
