Collect for John Vianney

God of love,
who filled your servant John Vianney
with zeal as a priest, pastor, and confessor: 
help us, by your grace, 
to win all our brothers and sisters for Christ
and to share with them in eternal glory; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
