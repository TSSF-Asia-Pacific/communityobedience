Collect for Margaret of Cortona

Merciful and loving God,
through your gracious goodness
you brought Margaret of Cortona
from the path of sin to the way of salvation;
in the same mercy may we who have often gone astray
also come to repentance
and be recreated in your image and likeness;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
