Collect for The Stigmata of Saint Francis

Almighty God,
when the world was growing cold
you inflamed the hearts of your people with the fire of your love;
you raised up blessed Francis,
bearing in his body the marks of Christ crucified:
grant to us, your people, true penitence, 
and grace to bear the cross for love of him
who is alive and reigns with you
and the Holy Spirit, 
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
