Collect for Bonaventure

Everlasting God,
we praise you that you have given light to your church
by the witness of Bonaventure:
in our day, may your Holy Spirit raise up people
who by their teaching and guidance will show the fullness of your truth;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
