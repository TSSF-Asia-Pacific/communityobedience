Collect for Anglican Franciscan Pioneers

Lord God,
you kept the pioneers of the revival 
of the Franciscan life in the Anglican Communion 
faithful to Christ's pattern of poverty and humility:
may we, inspired by their example,
live in fidelity to our calling
and come to the perfection
you have shown us in your Son Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
