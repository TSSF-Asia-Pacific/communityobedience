Collect for Elizabeth of Hungary

Merciful God,
who helped Elizabeth of Hungary
to recognise and honour Christ in the poor:
grant that we may use the prosperity of this present world
for the glory of your eternal kingdom; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
