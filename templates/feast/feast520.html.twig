Collect for Bernadine of Siena

God of glory,
who gave your servant Bernardine
a most tender love of the Holy Name of Jesus,
grant that we may always be alive with the spirit of your love;
through Jesus Christ our Lord,
who lives and reigns with you,
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever.
AMEN
