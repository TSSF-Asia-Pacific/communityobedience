Collect for Sunday

God, 
your love led Francis and Clare to establish our three orders: 
draw us into your love that we may grow in love towards all 
those we know, for the sake of your Son, Jesus Christ, who 
gives himself in love to all. Amen.

Collect for Monday

God, 
you are always pleased to show yourself to those who are 
childlike and humble in spirit: help us to follow the example 
of our blessed father Francis, to look upon the wisdom of this 
world as foolishness, and to set our minds only on Christ Jesus 
and him crucified; to whom with you and the Holy Spirit be all 
glory for ever. Amen

Collect for Tuesday

God, 
you resist the proud and give grace to the humble: help us 
not to think proudly, but to serve you with the humility that 
pleases you, so we may walk in the steps of your servant Francis 
and receive the gift of your grace; through Jesus Christ our 
Lord. Amen

Collect for Wednesday

God, 
you have made your church rich through the poverty of blessed 
Francis: help us, like him, not to trust in earthly things, 
but to seek your heavenly gifts; through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
Amen

Collect for Thursday

God, 
by the life of blessed Francis you moved your people to a love 
of simple things: may we, after his example hold lightly to the 
things of this world and store up for ourselves treasure in 
heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen

Collect for Friday

Lord Jesus, 
in your servant Francis you displayed the wonderful power of the 
cross: help us always to follow you in the way of the cross, and 
give us strength to resist all temptation, and to you, Lord, with 
the Father and the Holy Spirit be all glory for ever. Amen

Collect for Saturday

Lord, 
without you our labour is wasted, but with you all who are weak 
can find strength: pour your Spirit on the Society of Saint Francis; 
give your labourers a pure intention, patient faith, sufficient 
success on earth, and the joy of serving you in heaven; through 
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
