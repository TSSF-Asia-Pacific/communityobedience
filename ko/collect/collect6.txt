Lord, without you our labour is wasted, but with you all who are weak can find strength: pour your Spirit on the Society of Saint Francis; give your labourers a pure intention, patient faith, sufficient success on earth, and the joy of serving you in heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen</strong>
