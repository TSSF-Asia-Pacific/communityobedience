The Second Note - Love
Jesus said, "I give you a new commandment: love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." (John 13:34 - 35(NRSV)) Love is the distinguishing feature of all true disciples of Christ who wish to dedicate themselves to him as his servants.
